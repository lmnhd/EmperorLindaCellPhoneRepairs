**Costs-Monthly**
1. OpenAI (RTAPI): $10
2. Render.com: $7
3. Phone: $2
4. SMS: $10 (basically not even worth the money unless you only expect a million important text messages! - might as well push guests to use web-chat!)

My recommendation: Buy it. For the PoC demo:

Buy the number ($1.15/month)
Update your TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER env var to +19045934780
Re-point the webhook URLs in Twilio to your Lambda/Vercel endpoints
You'll be able to send/receive test SMS immediately at low volume
When you're ready for production, the A2P 10DLC registration process requires:

Brand registration (~$4 one-time fee)
Campaign registration (~$10/month)
Use case: "Customer Care" or "Mixed"



A2P 10DLC Campaign fee ($10/month recurring) — You mentioned it in the notes below but didn't add it to the cost list. This is mandatory for production SMS in the US.

OpenAI text/Responses API — Your $10 covers the Realtime Voice API, but dispatcher.py (SMS handler) also calls OpenAI. At low volume it's probably $1-3/month, but it's a separate line item.

AWS costs — Lambda, DynamoDB, API Gateway. At PoC/small-shop volume you'll almost certainly stay in the free tier, but worth noting: ~$0-2/month.

Vercel — Frontend hosting. Free tier covers this easily at this scale: $0.

Revised monthly cost picture:

Item	Monthly
OpenAI Realtime API (voice)	$10
OpenAI Responses API (SMS/chat)	~$2
Render.com (voice server)	$7
Twilio phone number	$1.15
Twilio SMS (~600 msgs)	$10
A2P 10DLC campaign	$10
AWS (Lambda/DDB/APIGW)	~$0-2
Vercel	$0
Total	~$42-44/month
One-time costs: ~$4 (A2P brand registration)

What to charge:

For a local solo operator, 3-4x cost coverage is the floor, then you price to value (AI handles calls/texts 24/7 so Brandon doesn't have to):

Tier	Price	Rationale
Minimum viable	$99/mo	~2.3x costs, covers your time/support
Sweet spot	$149/mo	~3.5x, leaves meaningful margin
Premium (with setup fee)	$199/mo + $299 setup	If you're onboarding, configuring, training
At $149/month your gross margin is ~$105/month per client. The value prop (never miss a repair lead, 24/7 auto-response) easily justifies $149 to a shop doing even $3K/month in repairs.
